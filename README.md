# HERA-2
In the year 2014 there were nearly 72k child abuse victims that had been reported. Yup, 72k enough to
fill 3 football stadium .In the year 2017 it's been doubled.
Taking this session as a good platform to represent my idea to reduce child abuse.My team and I have
developed an application that can be implemented in future in order to reduce child abuse and for their
safety purpose.
This app will send an alert message with the exact location of the child when the child is being abused or
forced to do something inaproppriate.
what else can it do ?

This app will help you to identify the person's intention of abusing the child through any social medium.
what else?
If a child's picture or video in inappropriate form is been circulated over the internet, an option in this
application will help you to backtrack and find the victim involved in the crime.
Is this solution inappropriate to the given problem statements-dude! Prevention is better than cure.
Brief description of the app will be as follows
Oxytocin and prolactin segregation in human body is detected using any iot system and then this information or test results are uploaded to the HERA application based on our algorithm. 
If any inappropriate segregation is detected it may possibly be a child abuse.
Thus the app will alert the appropriate person.
